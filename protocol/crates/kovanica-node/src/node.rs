//! The node: an in-memory [`Ledger`] and [`Mempool`], plus the operations a node
//! offers — bring up a genesis, build/pack/submit spends, produce blocks, gossip
//! blocks with peers, query balances and tips, and save/load its state.
//!
//! For demonstration and testing, actors are identified by a small integer
//! *seed* — the node derives `KeyPair::from_u64(seed)` for them and signs on
//! their behalf (single-UTXO coin selection: it spends one existing output that
//! covers the amount and returns the change). A real node never holds spending
//! keys or does wallet work; that lives client-side. This keeps the binary a
//! runnable, self-contained demo of the whole stack.
